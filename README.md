# Overview

As an aspiring software developer, I aim to build a strong foundation in programming by developing practical projects that help me understand language syntax and logic. My goal is to gain hands-on experience and deepen my problem-solving skills through real-world applications.

For this project, I created a basic calculator in Kotlin. It takes user input for two numbers and an operator, then uses a when expression to perform the corresponding calculation.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of Kotlin syntax and user input handling while building a functional program that performs arithmetic operations.

# Development Environment

I used IntelliJ IDEA along with the latest JDK to write, compile, and run my Kotlin code. The IDE provided helpful features such as syntax highlighting, real-time error detection, and code suggestions, which made the development process smoother.

The project was built using Kotlin, a modern statically typed language developed by JetBrains. I didnâ€™t use any additional libraries for this simple calculator, focusing purely on core language features.

# Future Work

- Refactor code to improve readability and modularity
- Add inline comments to explain logic and structure
- Expand functionality to include more operations like modulus or exponentiation
- Add input validation and error handling
